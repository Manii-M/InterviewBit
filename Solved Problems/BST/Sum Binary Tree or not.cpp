/**
 * Sum binary tree or not
Problem Description

Given a binary tree. Check whether the given tree is a Sum-binary Tree or not.

Sum-binary Tree is a Binary Tree where the value of a every node is equal to sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree.

An empty tree is Sum-binary Tree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.

Return 1 if it sum-binary tree else return 0.



Problem Constraints
1 <= length of the array <= 100000

0 <= node values <= 50



Input Format
The only argument given is the root node of tree A.



Output Format
Return 1 if it is sum-binary tree else return 0.



Example Input
Input 1:

       26
     /    \
    10     3
   /  \     \
  4   6      3
Input 2:

       26
     /    \
    10     3
   /  \     \
  4   6      4


Example Output
Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 All leaf nodes are considered as SumTree. 
 Value of Node 10 = 4 + 6.
 Value of Node 3 = 0 + 3 
 Value of Node 26 = 20 + 6 
Explanation 2:

 Sum of left subtree and right subtree is 27 which is not equal to the value of root node which is 26.
